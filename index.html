          Life will become much easier when we will finally understand which hands to shake and which ones to Hold.
          Be thankful and proud of the struggles you had in your life. They shaped you in the person you are today.

          You’re happy in your life as long as you’re content. Just believe in yourself and dream big. Do not give up on
          your hopes.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><code>Life is short</code>live it. Love is rare, grab it. Anger is bad, dump it. Fear is awful, face it.
          Memories are sweet, cherish it!
          When life seems unbearable, hold on. Because you have not yet seen the next page of the book of life. It is
          full of unknown mysteries, suspense, adventures and unachieved success.
        </p>
        <p>Life asked with Death: Why people love me and hate you, “Death said you are a beautiful lie and I’m a painful
          truth.
          Be happy and grateful for your life and the things you have achieved in this lifetime. There are people who
          have less than us but much happier than us.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cry</li>
          <li>Enjoy</li>
          <li>Be Happy</li>
          <li>Be frendly</li>
          <li>Be Seirus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Life is about hard work, endurance and love. If you work hard to make your dreams come true, endure pain
          while fighting for it; eventually, you will win success and love one day.</p>
        <p><code>I know</code> a man who stops asking ‘why’ and started saying ‘why not’. He is one of the most
          successful men in the world now. The way we respond to life today will shape our destiny tomorrow.</p>
        <p>If you believe in hard work and determination, luck will one day be with you eventually. It is in your hand
          to make yourself happy and successful.
          You are wasting your time if you’re worrying about failures. Worry about the chances you got but you decided
          not to try. Success is waiting at your doorstep.</p>
        <p>Do not measure yourself by success, failure or a degree. Measure your life by the dreams you have. It will
          become beautiful eventually.
          During our dark times, we may see the challenge in every opportunity. But we often forget that there is
          success hiding behind every challenge. Be optimistic and a fighter.</p>
        <p><code>You can. You will. Have faith in yourself. The word “YOU” has power in it.</code></p>

          Home works

        <p><code>October 2003. The rain lashes against the window. The sausage stroganoff is cooking peacefully on the stove. But it is anything else but peaceful in our home right now. My sons Max 10 years and Simon 8 years old, refuses to do homework. The same argument every day. They want to play, play football or ride a bike instead. Or curl up on the couch and watch a movie. But no! Homework shall be done! As a parent you feel incredible pressure when it comes to homework.

        </code></p>
        <p>If the children do not complete their homework outside of school, they get yelled at when getting back next
          day. In development discussions, homework is a constant reminder. It is important to make them. For the kids’
          sake. Sometimes I just wanted to throw out books and homework out the window and tell my sons that ”now we
          ignore the damn homework.”</p>
        <p>Instead, I took the fight. I, as student studying to be a teacher, surely should be able to get his own
          children to do their homework. And what a fight it was. My sons were stubborn, but certainly not more stubborn
          than other children. I understand if parents give up and do not bother to nag about
          homework.<code>homework.</code></p>
        <p>
          <code>Here was the first seed sowed towards homework- and exam free teaching. If I, as teacher student, cannot get my own kids to do homework, how is the single mother of three who works shifts at the hospital succeed with it? Why cannot the children’s work be completed in school? What part of the syllabus failed so miserably that we have to send assignments home? It’s every teachers’ job to ensure that student learning occurs during school time.</code>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Study</li>
          <li>Learn</li>
          <li>Teach</li>
          <li>Knowledge</li>
          <li>Make friends</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learning primarily, not homework</p>
        <p>The core content is vigorous, and at times it feels as if I do not have time for everything. But is homework
          really the right way to achieve what must get done?
          In a search for ”the homework history”, it reveals the following:
          1962: The primary school curriculum says that homework is a form of labor education and a way to acquire
          knowledge.</p>
        <p><code>1969: The curriculum states that all homework shall be voluntary for the schools.
          1980: Homework for students is part of the school’s work.
          1990s: The homework disappears completely from the curriculum, policy documents and school law. Even in teacher education texts and reports have homework disappeared. Meanwhile, the students’ own responsibility for their studies tightened in the policy documents.
        </code></p>
        <p>Homework was thus a penalty in the 60’s, and apparently it is still a punishment. Because I have met very few
          students who have done the homework with joy. In the late 60’s homework transitions to become optional. The
          problem with the optional homework is that it is the teacher who decides whether students will have homework
          due or not. But in the 80s, a major revolution happens. The homework becomes apart of the schools’ way to
          operate. Of course this takes place during my school years. A look in the rearview mirror shows that I did not
          do my homework to the extent my teachers wanted. As a miracle, the homework is removed from the syllabus in
          the 90s. The question is how many teachers stopped handing out homework during this decade?
        </p>
        <p><code>Homework is therefore not in any of our governing documents, but lots of homework is still handed out in all Swedish schools. The reasoning may be anything from that there is not enough time to go through the central content to that students must finish what they did not complete in the lesson. Students often become suffering for the school’s shortcomings. Fortunately for the teachers that there is not student unions. Because then the students had gone on strike. In my eyes it is a shortcoming in the teacher’s ability to educate if homework is handed out.</code></p>
        <p>Sometimes I think back on that October evening. That my sons and I fought about homework, which was not
          mandatory but felt like mandatory. The feeling of
          I-do-not-want-my-kids-to-be-yelled-at-because-they-have-not-finished-their-homework was so incredibly large.
          And who am I to expose my children to that sort of humiliation when they come back to school?

        <p><code>Here is the car of the future!     This car is the opposite of todays' cars; today's cars are noisy and dirty, this one is silent and clean. Today's cars have wheels, this one does not. It moves like a snail, but much faster than a snail !</code></p>
        <p><code></code> This car will use electric energy, not petrol or gasolene; it will have batteries that can be
          recharged instantly from chargers in the road. It will also be very easy to drive.
        </p>
        <p>In fact, you won't need to drive it; it will drive itself. You will just need to tell the computer: "Go to X"
          and the car will go there. Also, it will reach X very quickly, much faster than today's cars. It will also be
          very safe and comfortable.
          A lot of the technology already exists, but it is very experimental. Already today scientists are developing
          new materials for the surface of roads: In fifty years from now, perhaps sooner, some new roads will capture
          solar energy : they will store this energy under the road, and some cars will be able to use it.
          However you probably won't ever drive a "snail car", even if you're under 20 today. This, perhaps, is the car
          of the year 2100,
          <code>the car that your grandchildren will maybe drive.</code>
        </p>
        <p><code>For a start, will there even be cars in 2050? Will an invention that will be 150 years old by then be replaced by something better? Will environmental concerns kill it? Will people become tired of getting behind the wheel, as recent studies suggest? The answer seems to be “maybe”, but the reality is that the automobile is a very liberating and flexible means of transportation. It fulfills people’s desire to move around freely and independently. And – done right - the automobile can be a sustainable and safe means of transportation.</code></p>
        <p><code>Driving will be nice in the 22nd century ! No pollution, no traffic-jams, no stress.
          If, of course, we reach the 22nd century....With all today's problems of global warming, pollution, viruses and natural resources, nothing is certain any more. Scientists have lots of ideas about the car of the future: but the future itself is perhaps less sure.....

        <p>On a sunny day last January, people flocked to Las Vegas to zip around a parking lot in small vehicles that
          looked more like colorful eggs than ordinary cars. The automobiles were electric, rolled on two wheels instead
          of four and held only two passengers. Thanks to their tiny size, six of the vehicles would fit in a parking
          spot. If the idea of parking such a small car makes you nervous, don’t worry: These cars can park themselves.

        </p>
        <p>The vehicle is called the EN-V (pronounced like envy). It is built by the General Motors, or GM, car company
          and points to what future automobiles might be like. One day, such small, electric vehicles might safely
          shuttle people around, especially in crowded cities.

        </p>
        <p>Scientists and engineers are finding new ways to make cars safer, smarter and more efficient, or use less
          energy. New cars may help you keep track of your health by reminding you to take medication. If it’s electric,
          your car may send you a text reminding you to plug it in. Cars will talk to other cars, your computer, your
          phone and almost any other device. They’ll help drivers save energy, watch out for other drivers and avoid
          pedestrians.

        </p>
        <p>
          This is the future of automobiles: safer, smarter and more energy-conscious. As an added bonus, they might
          even drive themselves down the highway or through a city. You can sit back and enjoy the ride.

        </p>
        <p>Google is well known for its Internet search engine, but last year the company hit the highway. It sent a
          fleet of six self-driving cars into the world. Each wore a contraption on the top that looked like a wide
          metal headband topped by a small, spinning cylinder. People rode inside, but only to give directions and
          ensure that the car ran correctly.

        <p><code>Most teenagers in Britain receive pocket money from their parents. A report by the Bank of Scotland interviewed over 1,000 young people in Britain and found that 77 per cent get pocket money. They might have to do chores to get their pocket money, helping at home with tasks like cleaning, cooking, washing up, taking out the rubbish and ironing.
          
        </code></p>
        <p><code>Different families give different amounts and the average for eight- to fifteen-year-olds in the UK is about £6 a week. Children in Scotland receive more than the national average and Londoners get the most. Teenagers, logically, get more money than younger children. Some fifteen- to nineteen-year-olds receive more than £100 a month. The report found that many children save at least a quarter of their weekly pocket money and that more boys than girls save their money. 

        </code></p>
        <p><code>A part-time job is an option for teenagers who don’t have pocket money or who want to earn extra money. About 15 per cent of teenagers have a job. Only children over 13 can work but there are some exceptions, for example, for actors. Popular part-time jobs for teens include babysitting, delivering newspapers to houses, shop work and restaurant or café work.

        </code></p>
        <p><code>There are strict government laws about children working. They can work a maximum of two hours a day on a school day but not during school hours. At weekends and during school holidays, they can work longer hours. As for wages, the national minimum wage for under-18s is around £4 per hour and it increases every year. The minimum wage is higher if you are older.

        </code></p>
        <p><code>
          I babysit for my neighbours. Looking after young children in their home when their parents have gone out for the evening is a popular job for teenagers. You get paid for watching children and television all at the same time!
Sam, 16, from Chesterfield

I work in a greengrocer’s shop on Saturday mornings. I get £5 an hour. Not much but it means I can buy new clothes or whatever I want.

          <li>Be chill</li>
          <li>Do it great</li>
          <li>Save your money</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In Britain, some children and teenagers have a bank account. There is no legal age limit at which you can
          open a bank account but a bank manager can decide whether to allow a child or young person to open an account.
          Parents can put pocket money directly into their child’s bank account. Some banks have a prepaid bank card
          designed for young people. Parents can add pocket money to the card then children can use it to pay for
          things, without carrying money.

        </p>
        <p>I don’t need a bank account – I keep my money in my piggy bank at home. I’m saving up for some new football
          boots. My dad says that it’s not the safest place to keep money but at least the bank isn’t making a profit
          from my money!
          Ruth, 13, from Warwick</p>
        <p>So, many teenagers are getting experience of working part-time, dealing with banks and deciding whether to
          save or spend their money. These are all steps towards becoming a financially independent adult and earning
          and looking after your own money.

        <header>Sad dead</header>
        <p><code>To find out what is death</code> there must be no distance between death and you who are living with
          your troubles and all the rest of it; you must understand the significance of death and live with it while you
          are fairly alert, not completely dead, not quite dead yet. That thing called death is the end of everything
          that you know. Your body, your mind, your work, your ambitions, the things that you have built up, the things
          that you want to do, the things that you have not finished, the things that you have been trying to finish –
          there is an end of all these when death comes. That is the fact: the end. What happens afterwards is quite
          another matter; that is not important because you will not inquire what happens afterwards if there is no
          fear. Then death becomes something extraordinary, not sadistically, not abnormally or unhealthily, because
          death then is something unknown, and there is immense beauty in that which is unknown. These are not just
          words.
        </p>
        <p><code>So to find out the whole significance of death, what it means, to see the immensity of it, not just the stupid, symbolic image of death, this fear of living and the fear of dying must completely cease, not only consciously but also deep down. Our lives being empty we try to give significance to life, meaning to life. We ask, ‘What is the purpose of living?’ because our own lives are shallow, worthless and we think we must have an ideal to live by. It is all nonsense. So fear is the origin of the separation between that fact which you call death and that fact which you call living. What does death mean actually, not theoretically? We are not discussing theoretically, we are not discussing merely to formulate an idea, a concept. We are talking of facts, and if you reduce a fact merely into a theory, it is your own misfortune. You will live with your own shadow of fear and your life will end miserably as it has begun miserably.</code></p>
        <p>So you have to find out how to live with death. Not a method; you cannot have a method to live with something
          you don’t know. You cannot have that idea and say, ‘Tell me the method and I will practise it and I will live
          with death.’ That has no meaning. You have to find out what it means to live with something that must be an
          astonishing thing, actually to see it, actually to feel it – to be aware of this thing called death and of
          which you are so terribly frightened. What does it mean to live with something which you don’t know? I don’t
          know if you have ever thought about it at all in that way; probably you have not. All that you have done is,
          being frightened of it you try to avoid it, you do not look at it. Or you jump to some hopeful ideal or belief
          and thereby avoid it. But you have really to find out what death means, and whether you can live with it as
          you would live with your wife or husband, with your children, your job, your anxiety. You live with all these,
          don’t you? You live with your boredom, your fears. Can you live in the same way with something that you don’t
          know?<code></code></p>

          <li>Shitting</li>
          <li>SAD</li>
        </ul>
        <p> So you have to find out how to live with death. Not a method; you cannot have a method to live with
          something you don’t know. You cannot have that idea and say, ‘Tell me the method and I will practise it and I
          will live with death.’ That has no meaning. You have to find out what it means to live with something that
          must be an astonishing thing, actually to see it, actually to feel it – to be aware of this thing called death
          and of which you are so terribly frightened. What does it mean to live with something which you don’t know? I
          don’t know if you have ever thought about it at all in that way; probably you have not. All that you have done
          is, being frightened of it you try to avoid it, you do not look at it. Or you jump to some hopeful ideal or
          belief and thereby avoid it. But you have really to find out what death means, and whether you can live with
          it as you would live with your wife or husband, with your children, your job, your anxiety. You live with all
          these, don’t you? You live with your boredom, your fears. Can you live in the same way with something that you
          don’t know?
        </p>
        <p>To find out what it means to live, not only with the thing called life but also with death, which is the
          unknown, to go into it very deeply, we must die to the things that we know. I am talking about psychological
          knowledge, not of things like your home or office. We are talking about dying to the things that your mind
          clings to. You know, we want to die to the things which give us pain; we want to die to the insults, but we
          cling to the flattery. We want to die to the pain but we hold on like grim death to the pleasure. Please
          observe your own mind. Can you die to that pleasure, not eventually but now? You do not reason with death, you
          cannot have a prolonged argument with death. You have to die voluntarily to your pleasure, which does not mean
          that you become harsh, brutal, ugly, like one of the saints – on the contrary, you become highly sensitive;
          sensitive to beauty, to dirt, to squalor; and being sensitive, you care infinitely.
        </p>
        <p>Now, is it possible to die to that which you know about yourself? To die – I am taking a very superficial
          example – to a habit, to put away a particular habit either of drinking or smoking, having a particular kind
          of food, or the habit of sex, completely to withdraw from it without an effort, without a struggle, without a
          conflict. Then you will see that you have left behind the knowledge, the experience, the memories of all the
          things that you have known and learnt and lived by. And therefore you are no longer afraid, and your mind is
          astonishingly clear to observe what this extraordinary phenomenon is, of which man has been frightened through
          millennia, to observe something which you are confronted with, which is of no time, and which in its entirety
          is the unknown. Only that mind can so observe, which is not afraid and which is therefore free from the known
          – the known of your anger, your ambitions, your greeds, your petty little pursuits. All these are the known.
          You have to die to them, to let them go voluntarily, to drop them easily, without any conflict. And it is
          possible; this is not a theory. Then the mind is rejuvenated, young, innocent, fresh; and therefore it can
          live with that thing called death. Then you will see that life has an entirely different substance. Then life
          and death are not divided; they are one, because you are dying every minute of the day in order to live. And
          you must die every day to live, otherwise you merely carry along the repetition like a gramophone record,
          repeating, repeating, repeating.
        </p>
        <p>So when you really have the perfume of this thing, in your breath, in your being; not on some rare occasions
          but every day, waking and sleeping, then you will see for yourself, without somebody telling you, what an
          extraordinary thing it is to live, with actuality, not with words and symbols, to live with death and
          therefore to live every minute in a world in which there is not the known, but there is always the freedom
          from the known. It is only such a mind that can see what is truth, what is beauty and that which is from the
          everlasting to the everlasting.

        <p>What does death mean to you? Have you ever considered the question or do you postpone that dreadful event and
          carry on, knowing all around you there is death? When you see the victims of the recent wars in the Far East,
          that appalling suffering, misery, destroying marvellous trees, and a poor child not knowing what it is all
          about, crying on the roadside, when you look at all that, what is death? You must have considered it. For most
          of us does death mean the ending of life? Is that what we are frightened about? And what is our daily life to
          which we cling to so enormously? May I ask you, have you thought about it at all, have you inquired into it,
          have you made research into this enormous problem which has confronted man from the beginning of time? What
          does it mean to you?</p>
